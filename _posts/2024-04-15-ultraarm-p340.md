ultraArm is a small desktop robotic arm. It is designed with classic metal structure and occupies only an area of A5 paper. It is equipped with high-performance stepper motors, and it owns ±0.1mm repeated positioning accuracy and high stability. UltraArm can achieve the precise writing and drawing, laser engraving, and can be freely matched with multiple accessories such as slide rail, conveyor belt, myAGV and cameras. It can complete different practical training projects according to different needs, and is widely used in many fields such as higher education, scientific research, vocational application education, etc.
UltraArm is compact and tough with metal structure. 340mm working radius, 650g payload, small but powerful. ultraArm helps you achieve more applications.
ultraArm P340 is a cooperative mechanical arm perfectly used in combination with the package, python development kit, ROS2 robot operating system and other creation-learning platforms helps you complete a variety of program designs, analyze the simplest to complex programs one by one, and respond to your needs in a bright and flexible way
