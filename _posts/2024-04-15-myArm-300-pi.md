The myArm 300 Pi is an integrated 7-DOF robot that uses the Raspberry Pi 4B as its main control board. It is paired with the Ubuntu Mate 20.04 OS, specifically customized for robots by Elephant Robot. No additional PC controller is needed. By simply connecting a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, users can easily start basic development. This ensures that the robot no longer requires an external controller but still provides an experience similar to a desktop PC.

The myArm robot offers a maximum working arm length of 300mm, 7 DOF moving joints, supports a maximum end load of 200g, controls for zero-space posture elbow angles (elbow joint rotation angle), and supports extensions for myCobot series robot accessories. It is the preferred choice for rapid construction of robotic arm education, control logic teaching, robot applications, and ROS simulation classes, helping you quickly start learning and applying the 7-axis robotic arm.
