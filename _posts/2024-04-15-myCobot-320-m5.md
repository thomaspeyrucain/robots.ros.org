MyCobot 320 is another member of the myCobot family of products, and is a practical robot developed for user independent programming. There are currently two versions of myCobot 320 for M5 and myCobot 320 for Pi, and the overall product is exquisitely designed, continuing the all in one design of the myCobot series. The maximum effective arm span of the product is 350mm, the maximum load is 1KG, and the repeated positioning accuracy is ± 0.5mm. As the first ten thousand yuan mechanical arm of the elephant robot, it has three major advantages: ease of use, safety, and economy, making it a cost-effective choice.
MyCobot 320 M5 supports free to match visual development applications, provides intuitive mechanical motion principle construction analysis, and enterprise level communication protocol specifications and applications.
Equipped with up to 12 standard 24V industrial I/O interfaces, expandable PLC control for independent programming, supporting mainstream control language interfaces in the industry, developing communication protocols for robotic arms, and rich end extension accessories to help explore the boundaries of personal applications.
